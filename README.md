Download MNIST dataset and saving them as .jpg format in 10 different files

Well, well, well... I used MNIST dataset, but they were saved in .gz format( # I supposeï¼Ÿmaybe I am wrong, my mind explode since the final project coming ), which is not quite convenient for me to "see" it.
So I change them into .jpg format and save them in each files.
